# Product Context - AI Math Tutor

## Why This Product Exists

Students are drowning in homework answers but lacking understanding. They copy solutions, memorize procedures, but can't apply concepts to new problems. We need a patient, infinitely available tutor that teaches _how to think_, not just _what to do_.

## User Problems Being Solved

### Problem 1: Knowledge Transfer Failure

- Students receive tutoring but don't learn underlying concepts
- When facing new problems, they're stuck
- _Solution:_ Socratic method forces genuine understanding

### Problem 2: Accessibility & Cost

- Good tutors are expensive ($30-100/hour)
- Available limited hours
- _Solution:_ AI provides unlimited, 24/7 access at zero cost

### Problem 3: Patience & Judgment-Free Learning

- Students feel embarrassed asking "dumb" questions
- Human tutors get frustrated
- _Solution:_ Patient AI never judges, always encouraging

### Problem 4: Adaptability

- One-size-fits-all approaches don't work
- Students need different pacing/explanation levels
- _Solution:_ AI adjusts questions based on responses

## How It Should Work (User Journey)

### Student Perspective

1. **Sign up** → Quick auth (email or Google)
2. **Ask a question** → Type "Solve 2x + 5 = 13" or upload photo
3. **Get guided** → AI asks "What are we solving for?" → "To isolate x, what do we undo?"
4. **Discover solution** → Student arrives at answer through reasoning
5. **Celebrate** → AI confirms with encouragement
6. **Continue learning** → Can ask follow-ups, try similar problems

### Teacher/Researcher Perspective

- Access conversation history
- Analyze questioning patterns
- Study learning trajectories
- Evaluate AI's pedagogical effectiveness

## Design Philosophy

### Core Principles

- **Socratic First:** Never give answers, only guide
- **Student-Centered:** Adapt to individual pacing and understanding
- **Encouraging:** Build confidence, celebrate thinking
