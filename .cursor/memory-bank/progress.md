   - React Router setup

2. **Short Term (Next 12 hours):** Tasks 1.3-1.6

   - Chat UI components
   - Socratic dialogue backend
   - Frontend-backend integration
   - Math rendering

3. **Medium Term:** Tasks 1.7-1.9

   - Conversation persistence
   - Image upload

4. **Milestones:**
   - **Week 1:** Complete MVP core (auth + chat + persistence)
   - **Week 2:** Add image upload + OCR + conversation history UI
   - **Week 3:** Polish, testing, deployment prep
   - **Week 4+:** Stretch features (whiteboard, voice, problem generation)

## Development Velocity

- **Current:** 6-8 hours completed in Task 1.1
- **Rate:** Approximately 3-4 hours per task on average
- **Forecast:** MVP (Phase 1-4) in 2-3 weeks with consistent effort

## Code Quality Status

- ✅ No linting errors
- ✅ Following project standards (hooks, context, Tailwind)
- ✅ Proper folder organization
- ✅ Git initialized

## Testing Status

- ✅ Dev environment verified working
- ✅ Emulators verified running
- ⏳ Full authentication flow (pending)
